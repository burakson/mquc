  "history" : "Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto 'Més que un club' (More than a club). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the second most valuable sports team on the globe, worth $3.2 billion, and the world's second-richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of $613 million. The official Barcelona anthem is the 'Cant del Barça', written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.",
